J.A.R.V.I.S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an AI assistant built by **Nirbhay** (a.k.a Strange Stark), inspired by the fictional AI from *Iron Man*. This assistant performs a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, controlling system operations, and providing smart responses, all powered by Python and external APIs.

## üåü Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Capture user commands through speech.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: J.A.R.V.I.S responds audibly with spoken feedback.
- **System Commands**: Perform system operations like shutdown, restart, and log out.
- **Web Search**: Search Wikipedia, Google, and YouTube.
- **News Updates**: Get real-time news from the top news sources.
- **Battery Information**: Check battery status, percentage, and time left.
- **Email & WhatsApp**: Send emails and WhatsApp messages directly from J.A.R.V.I.S.
- **Chat History**: Keeps track of interactions and provides context to MetaAI for intelligent responses.
- **Calculator**: A built-in calculator for quick math.
- **IP Address**: Fetch your public IP address.
  
## üîß Libraries & Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries:

- **wikipedia**: For Wikipedia search.
- **pyautogui**: For automating system interactions.
- **requests**: To make API requests for weather, news, etc.
- **psutil**: To monitor system resources (battery status, CPU usage).
- **pywhatkit**: For controlling YouTube and WhatsApp.
- **pyfiglet**: For generating ASCII art.
- **meta_ai_api**: Integration with MetaAI for intelligent responses.
- **smtplib**: To send emails via SMTP.
- **webbrowser**: To open URLs in the browser.
- **time**, **os**, **datetime**: For system interactions and time-based operations.

## üß† MetaAI Integration

J.A.R.V.I.S leverages **MetaAI** to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. The assistant remembers previous conversations, allowing it to offer more relevant answers by using chat history stored in a file.

### Chat History:

- **What it does**: J.A.R.V.I.S stores a log of every interaction in a `chat_history.txt` file.
- **Why it matters**: This allows MetaAI to use past queries as context for smarter responses.
- **How it works**: Upon every launch, the chat history is passed to MetaAI to improve the assistant's answers.

```python
# Function to read chat history from file
def read_chat_history():
    try:
        with open(CHAT_HISTORY_FILE, "r") as file:
            return file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return ""

# Process user query and use chat history for MetaAI prompt
response = ai.prompt(
    message=f"""
    Current chat history:
    {read_chat_history()}

    Here's the user's query: {query}
    """
)
```
