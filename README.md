# J.A.R.V.I.S 1.1(Legacy)

Archived Python-based desktop assistant built during an early learning phase.

---

## Context
This project was created during my initial exploration of Python automation, APIs, and system interaction.  
It is inspired by the fictional “Jarvis” concept, but functions primarily as a rule-based assistant with external service integrations.

The codebase is not representative of my current architectural standards and is preserved for learning reference only.

---

## What it does
- Accepts voice input and responds using text-to-speech
- Executes basic system and automation commands
- Performs web searches and simple information retrieval
- Integrates third-party APIs for tasks like news and messaging

---

## Technical Scope
- Python-based scripting and automation
- Use of external libraries for speech, system control, and APIs
- No custom ML models — intelligence is delegated to external services

---

## Tech Stack
Python  
SpeechRecognition • pyttsx3 • OpenCV • requests • psutil • pyautogui

---

## Status
Archived — legacy experimentation project.

## Notes
This project reflects early-stage experimentation and rapid prototyping rather than production-level design.  
More structured and system-oriented work is continued in separate projects.
